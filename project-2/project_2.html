            <p>Quicksand is a display sans serif with rounded terminals. The project was initiated by Andrew
                Paglinawan in 2008 using geometric shapes as a core foundation. It is designed for display purposes
                but kept legible enough to use in small sizes as well. In 2016, in collaboration with Andrew, it was
                thoroughly revised by Thomas Jockin to improve the quality. In 2019, Mirko Velimirovic converted the
                family into a variable font.</p>

            <p>Quicksand is a mixture of water and fine granular <br> material, such as sand, silt, or clay. It forms when <br>
                the sand is suddenly agitated and the water cannot <br> escape. The water and sand separate, leaving <br> a layer
                of densely packed wet sand.</p>

                <p>Quicksand is a natural <br> phenomenon consisting of <br> water-saturated sand or <br> soil that behaves like a <br> viscous fluid, often found <br> in marshy or sandy areas.</p>

            <p>Quicksand looks solid, but when pressure is applied it <br> liquifies. If animals or people stand on it, they sink into it.<br> However, a person does not drown in quicksand. You would <br>descend about up to your waist, but you'd go no further.</p>

            <h4>Magnetized Sand Flows Uphill Against Gravity</h4>
            <h5>The sands of science are shifting, and they are flowing in unexpected directions.</h5>
            <p>Increasing the magnetic force increases the cohesion, giving grains more traction <br> and speed to their
                movement. The collective motion and adhesion among the <br> grains enable piles of sand particles to
                collaboratively perform surprising feats, <br> such as flowing up walls and climbing stairs.</p>
